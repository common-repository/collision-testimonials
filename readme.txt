== Description ==

With Collision Testimonials, you can easily manage the testimonials for your website. We allow you to configure the testimonial prefix, suffix, and even the number of testimonials displayed on your WordPress site.

You can feature, sort, and set the status (Hidden, Pending, Public) of testimonials.  We even allow you to have a form so your users can submit testimonials right on your website.  Best of all, they are marked pending and require your approval before they go public!

We allow you to display a random number of testimonials on your websites sidebar, using either our widget, or this tag (<code>&lt;?php collision_testimonials(); ?&gt;</code>).  You can also have a testimonials page, where you display all your testimonials.  We allow you to feature testimonials and set the order in which they are displayed!  You truly have full control with our plugin!

Our plugin is highly configurable via our settings page. You choose how many testimonials are displayed, the prefix/suffix for regular testimonials, featured testimonials, and you can even have a different prefix/suffix for your testimonials page.

A few features:<br />
 - Manage your testimonials. (Add, Edit, and Delete! Yep, full CRUD!)<br />
 - Highly configurable via our graphical interface.<br />
 - Set number of testimonials to display.<br />
 - Configure the testimonial prefix and suffix.<br />
 - Collect the following information for each testimonial: Name, Location, Testimonial, and Website.<br />
 - Set status of testimonial to "Public", "Hidden", and even "Pending Approval".  This allows you to hide a testimonial rather then deleting the testimonial from the database entirely.<br />
  - Display all public testimonials on a testimonials page, using our testimonials page tag. (<code>&lt;!-- collision_testimonials_page --&gt;</code>)<br />
 - Allow visitors to submit testimonials through a web form. Just add this tag to the page where you'd like the submission form to appear! (<code>&lt;!-- collision_testimonials_form --&gt;</code>) 
 - Feature testimonials.
 - Choose who can manage testimonials.
 - And so much more....
